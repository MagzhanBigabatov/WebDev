    <p>It's common for web developers to work with designers who focus on creating user interfaces and user experiences. Designers use software like Adobe Photoshop to mock up - draw - 
        websites. The mockups that they create are usually just images of websites with some annotations and descriptions.

    As a web developer, one of the tasks you might be asked to do is take a mockup created by a visual designer and translate it into a live website. I use the word 
    "translate" because the process of going from mockup to website is similar to the process of translating between natural languages. Just as you can create the 
    same meaning using different words and phrases with a natural language, you can create the same website design using different HTML elements.

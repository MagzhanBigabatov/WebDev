                <mark class = "line most">Lake Kaindy</mark> (also known the "birch tree lake" or landslide) is a 400-meter-long (1,300 ft) lake located in Kazakhstan. 
                The lake reaches depths of nearly 30 meters (98 ft). It is located 129 kilometers (80 ml) east-southeast of the city of Almaty and is 2,000 meters (6,600 ft) 
                above sea level. <br>
                <br>
                <mark class = "line most">Lake Kaindy</mark> is located in the south of Kazakhstan, within Kolsay Lakes National Park. It is located 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level, 130 kilometres (81 mi) 
                east of Almaty. The lake was formed as the result of a major limestone landslide triggered by the 1911 Kebin earthquake forming a natural dam. It blocked the gorge 
                and was filled by mountain river water. Lake Kaindy is about 400 meters long, reaching depths of nearly 30 meters at its deepest point. Altered by limestone deposits, 
                the water maintains a bluish-green color. <br>
                <br>
                <mark class= "line">The</mark> uniqueness of the lake lies in the fact that after a natural dam blocked the gorge, the water that filled the dam formed the lake and did not destroy the spruce 
                trees growing in this place along the river. (The Kaindy river flows into the lake, passing through a two-sided rock face about 20 meters high). The upper part of 
                the trees protruding from the water lost their side branches and bark, and the wood turned white. When you look at such a panorama, you get the feeling that you are 
                looking at a submerged squadron: the bare trunks of trees resemble the masts of submerged ships. The lake surface itself changes color regularly and is often a very 
                beautiful blue color. This strange color is caused by lime and other minerals that were in the water a hundred years ago. But as soon as you get closer to the lake, 
                the water becomes crystal clear, and sometimes you can even see trout in it. Despite the low water temperature, Kaindy lake is popular with diving enthusiasts.

                <mark class= "line most">Charyn Canyon</mark> is a canyon on the Sharyn River in Kazakhstan (200 kilometres (120 mi) 
                east of Almaty, close to the Chinese border). The canyon is roughly 154 kilometres (96 mi) in length. It is part of the Charyn National Park (established 
                on 23 February 2004), and is located within the territory of the Uygur District, Raiymbek District and Enbekshikazakh District in the Almaty Region. The canyon 
                features many formations formed by the weathering of sedimentary rock. Though it is much smaller than the Grand Canyon, it has been described as being equally 
                impressive.<br>
                <br>
                <mark class= "line">The</mark> canyon consists of a formation along the banks of the Charyn River of approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) (90 kilometres (56 mi) is also stated). 
                The river has a total length of 393 kilometres (244 mi).[4] The river originates from the Tian Shan Mountains that range over the arid semi-desert to eastern Almaty. 
                In various places, it attains a depth of 150 to 300 metres (490 to 980 ft). <br>
                <br>
                <mark class= "line">The</mark> Charyn Canyon consists of 5 different canyons: the Valley of Castles (the most popular part of the Charyn Canyon), the Temirlik Canyon, the Yellow Canyon, the Red Canyon 
                and the Bestamak Canyon. There are also a number of smaller canyons or tracts, including the Kurtogay Canyon and the Tazbas tract.
